	*For my first review project, I want to develop an application that would help me track gym progress. 
	Tracking your gym progress is essential to meeting goals at the gym, if you do not track your gym progress 
	you won't know how much you have improved, and you won't know how if you need to adjust your workout routine 
	to meet your goals. This project will be a Database GUI that would implement a graphical front end to a database. 
	Users will need to visually see their data in order to evaluate their gym progress. 


	*For my second review project I thought of is a cardio tracker. I am personally am not a fan of cardio, 
	but one of my goals in life is to run a marathon. Like my first review project this project will be a Database
	GUI. The application will generate articles referencing breathing exercises, running techniques, stretching, and hydration. 
	The references generated by the application will guide the user to reliable information about cardio, and 
	how to properly exercise. The application will also layout a conventional cardio plan that the users may 
	follow, this plan ensures steady progress for less experienced runners. Also, the application will populate 
	a graphical data chart that will show the progress of the user.  


	*For my third review project I am developing an invoice generator. 
	A friend of mine is an accountant and asked if I can develop an invoice generator. 
	For this project I will need to develop an application that will calculate the cost by a rate of a product. 
	I will also have to give a description of the service inventory and the quantity of rate as well. Essentially,
	I will be developing an invoice calculator. 


	*Each project reflects one of my personal goals. My First review projects, ensures that I can properly manage
	my gym hobby. My second project will help guided me to meet one of my life goals and run a marathon. My final
	review project enables me to have firsthand experience with a client, which is essential for future interactions.
